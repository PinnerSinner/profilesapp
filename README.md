# React + Vite

A React web app using Amplify to configure auth and data resources. Running in the back is a Lambda function to update the data model with the userâ€™s details when they sign up with a frontend to display the captured data. AWS Amplify to host the app! 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
